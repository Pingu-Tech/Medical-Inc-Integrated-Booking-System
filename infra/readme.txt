# Directory Status: Pending SRS Authorization

**NOTICE: Active Development is currently paused.**

This directory has been provisioned as part of the initial repository scaffolding by the Research & Development team during the Analysing phase. 

In strict adherence to Pingu Tech's Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) protocols, active development—including the commit of business logic, UI components, database migration scripts, or integration tests—is strictly prohibited at this stage.

## Next Steps
Source code initialization and active branching will commence exclusively after the following milestone is achieved:
1. **Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Sign-Off:** Final approval and validation of the SRS document by both Pingu Tech Executive Management and Medical Inc. stakeholders.

## Developer Instructions
* **Do not** commit application code or frameworks to this directory.
* **Do not** open feature branches for active coding until official clearance is provided.
* If you are onboarding, please review the architecture decision records (ADRs) and API contracts located in the `/docs/` directory to familiarize yourself with the technical constraints.
